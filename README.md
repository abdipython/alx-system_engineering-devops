so for the command line for the win here's how i did it .
 i finished the challenges and took my screenshots 
 i later connected my local pc terminal to the hosting tsandbox via      sftp> just like the ssh i was asked for my username and password which  i later navigated to the directory where i wanted to upload the files   to  i.e  /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
	 i copied the screenshots path  1 by 1 and using the put sfpt> fuction i uploaded them to my sandbox .
